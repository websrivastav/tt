<h4><strong>Only in the case of a system malfunction or if a ticket is canceled without cause will a refund be issued. The refund policy of Company Name is described in this article.</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The airline will not be able to repay tickets purchased via Company Name.com for any returns. Refunds must be requested through Company Name.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any cancellations made directly with the airline must be reported to Company Name through e-mail or phone number to begin the refund procedure.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes a different amount of time to cancel and get a refund.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All cancellations and partial cancellations are subject to a convenience charge, which is non-refundable.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The refund will be credited to the same account that was used to make the initial payment. The transaction will be reversed if the user pays using a credit card, for example. If the user pays using a debit card, the money will be credited to the debit card.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The compensation would be taken from the total at the time of the reservation in the case of a cancellation or return of partially used tickets.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the user cancels his or her reservation directly with the airline, he or she must inform the Company of the relevant documentation in order to begin the refund process.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is recommended that you contact the company within 48 hours after the request for cancellation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of meals is not reimbursable. (Reimbursable only if the airline cancels the flight.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company will be able to begin customer compensation only after receiving and/or confirmation from the airline.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Please note:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If your flight has been canceled or postponed, please notify us as soon as possible because we need this information from the official source. You may, however, contact us.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Cancellation, refund, and reservation policies</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Company Name.com should be contacted if a flight reservation is canceled. If the ticket can be refunded, a refund will be provided. Non-refundable flights are not eligible for refunds. Your flight charge with a low-cost carrier is also non-refundable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passengers will only be paid if they cancel non-refundable tickets and pay the airline fee to utilize the credit in the future. Depending on the airline, additional limitations and conditions may apply to the purchasing of plane tickets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Additional Fees for Rebooking a Flight</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of altering your flight is based on the airline and ticket type you choose when making your reservation. Each airline operates under its own set of rules and regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If other choices are available, you may be allowed to cancel your flight without penalty; however, this is not always possible. You may miss out on a better bargain or book your trip on the incorrect airline if you don’t do your study.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that the price of a flight might vary based on the ticket you choose.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note-</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Please be aware that airline costs will be adjusted by $100 to $300. Whether it’s an international or domestic flight. If the cost of your new flight is higher, you must pay this fee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The higher the ticket price, the better (you will need to pay change fees and the difference in price between the new and existing ticket).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the alternative ticket is less costly, you will not be reimbursed (according to airline policies).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Chargebacks</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A chargeback is requested when you are asked to reimburse your issuer to Company Name to reverse your payment and disable sending. Return to the trip date and purchase your order again to complete the reimbursement and receive your refund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please contact us to get a refund in the most convenient manner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Cancellation is simple.</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may travel without anxiety thanks to free cancellation from a single secure platform.</span></p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><b>Company Name can help you save money.</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you buy your tickets with Company Name, you will save money. You may easily alter the date and save money on cancellation fees by doing so.</span></p>
