<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Company Name Privacy Policy explains how Company Name collects, uses, and retains your personal information when you use Company Name, whether on the internet, in an app, or on your mobile phone. We do not use or disclose your information with anybody other than those with whom we have agreed to share it following our privacy policy. Data obtained from other sources or outside of established data collecting methods is unaffected by the following policies. Capitalized words that are not specified in this Privacy Policy provide meaning to the Terms of Service.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We,” “us,” and “our website” refer to www.Company Name.com, whereas “you,” “your,” and “yours” refer to you, the Company Name.com user. The term “personal information” refers to the information you give us that identifies you, such as your name, phone number, and email address, as well as any other information related to that information that can be used to contact or identify you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Information Gathering and Application</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Company Name collects and uses the information to analyze how the service is used, to diagnose service or technical problems, to maintain security, to customize the content, to record data to assist you with effective account access, to monitor aggregated metrics such as regarding visitors, traffic, and demographics, and to track users and user content as necessary to comply with copyright and information laws.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>User-supplied information</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you create a member account with the service, you provide us with personal information such as your name, e-mail address, and phone number. Your name, as well as any other information you choose to provide in your profile, will be shown publicly on the service. We can use your email or phone number to deliver service-related reminders. We may also use your contact information to send you marketing emails, push alerts, SMS, or IVR calls. If you do not want to receive similar communication in the future, you can opt-out by following the instructions in the message or by sending us an email. When you send us an email, we can save the content of your messages, your email address, and your answers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you use a debit, credit, or another sort of payment to your Company Name account, your card information is sent to a third party that processes payments for us. To protect your financial information, we do not save card information on our systems. On the website, every payment is secure. This includes using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption for any personal data communication. SSL is a well-known encoding technique that enables your browser to automatically encrypt or scramble data before delivering it to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may also have billing information entered on the site, such as debit/credit card details, in some cases, but only if the order is required. Unfortunately, in certain cases, these sensitive components are no longer required because they may be properly managed through third-party services like PayPal).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The information in our care is protected by our website’s strong security procedures against loss, mismanagement, and change. When you change or access your account information, we offer you the option of using a secure server. Once we receive your information, we adhere to stringent security protocols to keep it safe from unauthorized access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If personal information is compromised as a result of a security breach, Company Name must notify the persons whose personal information has been altered as soon as possible, in compliance with or as otherwise required by law, using the Notification Procedures outlined in this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p><b>Note-</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Please be aware that your privacy is of the utmost concern to us. We make every effort to keep all information about our clients safe, whether we obtain it directly from them, over the phone, or online.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Information is a personal choice.</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, if you use the Service, you can reject to send personal information to Company Name that isn’t relevant to your needs. You may always change or amend your account information and email settings by login into your accounts.
